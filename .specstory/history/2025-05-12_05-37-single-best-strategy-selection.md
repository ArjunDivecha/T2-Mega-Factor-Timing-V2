# Single Best Strategy Selection (2025-05-11 22:37:58)

_**User**_

lets change it to select only the one best stratgey

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the `Step_3_shrinkage_TOP5.py` script to select only the single best portfolio instead of the top 5. Here's how I'll do it:

I've successfully modified the script to select only the best-performing portfolio instead of the top 5 portfolios. The key changes include:

1. Updated the file documentation to reflect the single best portfolio approach
2. Changed the default parameter in `select_top_portfolios` from 5 to 1
3. Modified `equal_weight_portfolios` to assign 100% weight to the single best portfolio
4. Updated all relevant text outputs and comments to indicate the single portfolio selection
5. Changed the function descriptions to reflect the new approach

The script will now:
1. Find the single best-performing portfolio based on the training window data
2. Assign 100% weight to this portfolio
3. Evaluate the performance of this single portfolio on the test window

This simplified approach will let you see how well the single best-performing factor strategy works on out-of-sample data without any diversification across strategies.

@Step_3_shrinkage_TOP5.py lets change this to picking the top 3 factors instead of 1

I'll modify the script to select the top 3 factors instead of just 1. Here's how I'll do it:
