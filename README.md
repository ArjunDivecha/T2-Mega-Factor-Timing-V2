# Factor Timing Framework

A comprehensive framework for implementing and testing factor timing strategies, with proper handling of Cross-Sectional (CS) and Time-Series (TS) factors.

## Overview

This framework implements a robust factor timing methodology for financial markets, allowing for the optimization of portfolio weights using shrinkage techniques, factor rotation, and comprehensive performance evaluation. It analyzes both Cross-Sectional (CS) and Time-Series (TS) factors to identify the most effective combinations for portfolio construction.

## Key Features

- Analyzes 102 factors (49 cross-sectional and 53 time-series variants)
- Applies optimal regularization via shrinkage techniques
- Implements factor rotation to identify the most important factors
- Supports long-short and long-only constraints
- Provides comprehensive performance metrics and visualizations
- Maintains consistent separation between CS and TS factors
- Handles rolling window analysis for proper out-of-sample testing

## Workflow

The complete workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   ```
   python factor_timing_data_prep.py
   ```
   Loads the raw factor and conditioning variable data, prepares factor timing portfolios by combining factors with lagged predictors, and saves to `prepared_data.pkl`.

2. **Create Rolling Windows**:
   ```
   python factor_timing_rolling_windows.py
   ```
   Constructs rolling windows for training (60 months), validation (12 months), and testing (1 month) periods, saving the result to `rolling_windows.pkl`.

3. **Run Shrinkage Optimization**:
   ```
   python factor_timing_shrinkage.py [options]
   ```
   Optimizes portfolio weights using shrinkage techniques with Ledoit-Wolf covariance estimation, tuning the optimal lambda parameter for each window, and saving results to `shrinkage_results.pkl`.

4. **Extract Shrinkage Intensities**:
   ```
   python print_intensities.py
   ```
   Analyzes and displays the Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage intensities from the optimization results, showing how the covariance structure stability evolves across windows.

5. **Extract Optimal Weights**:
   ```
   python extract_weights.py
   ```
   Extracts the optimal weights for filtered timing portfolios from shrinkage results and saves them to `unrotated_optimal_weights.xlsx` for further analysis.

6. **Process Factor Rotation**:
   ```
   python factor_rotation.py [options]
   ```
   Rotates portfolio weights into factor weights, properly preserving CS and TS factor designations, saving to `rotated_optimal_weights.xlsx`.

7. **Run Complete Test Pipeline**:
   ```
   python run_factor_timing_test.py [options]
   ```
   Executes the full pipeline end-to-end, calculating comprehensive performance metrics, saving detailed results to `test_results.pkl` and `factor_timing_results.xlsx`.

8. **Generate Plots**:
   ```
   python plot_factor_results.py [options]
   ```
   Creates visualizations from test results without rerunning the entire pipeline, including lambda evolution, Sharpe ratios, cumulative returns, drawdowns, and factor weights.

9. **Analyze Factor Weights**:
   ```
   python analyze_weights.py
   ```
   Provides in-depth analysis of factor weights, including CS vs TS distribution and comparative performance.

## Command-Line Interface

All scripts use a consistent command-line interface, allowing you to specify window parameters in the same way across all components.

### Common Parameters

All scripts support the following parameters:

```
--window_indices INDICES   Specific window indices to process, comma-separated (e.g., "120,121,122")
--start_date DATE          Start date for test period (YYYY-MM-DD)
--end_date DATE            End date for test period (YYYY-MM-DD)
--max_windows N            Maximum number of windows to process (default: 5, 0 for all windows)
--max_portfolios N         Maximum number of portfolios to analyze (default: 2000)
--find_2010_window         Find and process window around 2010
```

**Note**: The parameters `--window_indices`, `--start_date/--end_date`, and `--find_2010_window` are mutually exclusive. If none are provided, the script will process up to `max_windows` most recent windows.

### Examples

1. Process specific window indices:
   ```
   python run_factor_timing_test.py --window_indices 120,121,122
   ```

2. Process windows in a date range:
   ```
   python run_factor_timing_test.py --start_date 2015-01-01 --end_date 2015-12-31
   ```

3. Process all windows:
   ```
   python run_factor_timing_test.py --max_windows 0
   ```

4. Generate only plots from existing results:
   ```
   python plot_factor_results.py
   ```

## Cross-Sectional vs Time-Series Factors

This framework carefully maintains the distinction between Cross-Sectional (CS) and Time-Series (TS) factors:

- **Cross-Sectional (CS)**: Factors based on the relative performance of securities within the same time period
- **Time-Series (TS)**: Factors based on the performance of securities relative to their own history

Analysis of CS vs TS factor performance reveals:
- Distribution between CS (42%) and TS (58%) factors in optimal portfolios
- Some factors perform better in CS form (e.g., Best ROE, 12MTR, Debt to EV)
- Others perform better in TS form (e.g., 12-1MTR, Inflation, 10Yr Bond)

## Performance Metrics

The framework calculates and reports comprehensive performance metrics including:
- Annualized returns
